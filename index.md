This is the course page
for the summer semester 2019 edition of the course
statistical natural language processing (NLP)
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

## Introduction

This course is a practical, broad and fast-paced introduction
to Natural Langauge Processing (NLP).
the course covers a variety of machine learning techniques
and their applications in NLP and computational linguistics.
The [schedule](schedule) includes for more information
on the topics and course material.

This is a 9ECTS course compulsory for the BA studies in
the [International Studies in Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/courses-of-study/courses-of-study-at-the-sfs/international-studies-in-computational-linguistics/ba-programme-iscl/) (ISCL).
Master's students can take the course as a "Hauptseminar"
for 6ECTS, or for 9ECTS with additional work (a term project/paper).
The course is also open to students of other degree programs
with appropriate background.
Please contact the instructor before signing up if you are
unsure whether you meet the requirements or not.
See the course [syllabus](snlp2019-syllabus.pdf) for further details.
